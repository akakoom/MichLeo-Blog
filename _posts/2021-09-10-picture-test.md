## Fursona Here

After making up my mind to have a beast set up, it took more than two years to come and go.
After a number of fine-tuning, the dumplings for me to finalize the draft.
Thank him for my brain cells burned a lot.

### 肉體模擬
The nano-polymer bionic body is essentially a nano-mechanical creature, 
usually made by compressing the nano-mechanical simulation of the body as a disguise, 
deliberately leaving scars in addition to nostalgia for the past flesh, 
but also part of the disguise as a biological body.

### 日常型態
The usual clothes are basically made of nano-machines, and when using nano-machines, they wear hoods to make the circuits glow, creating the impression that the use of nano-machines is controlled from the outside.

The gumdrops of unknown origin and undetermined material and age appear in the body when it becomes a nano creature, and when it is taken out, it pretends to be made of polymerized nano particles and can eject many chains of nano machinery from it.
